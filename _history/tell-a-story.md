In the previous pages, we’ve covered

  - “Metareading” as a type of reading focused on making declarations about at text *as* text
  - The concept of a “fluid text”
  - *Walden* as a fluid text
  - TimelineJS as a tool for building timelines
  - IIIF as a standard for making image files available for use in a multitude of web applications

With these concepts and tools, we can begin to think about what it would look like to tell the story of some interesting change that Thoreau made to *Walden*

### A story about the epigraph to *Walden*

The title page of the first edition of *Walden* includes this epigraph:

> *I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up. —Page 92.*

Thoreau was aware that his emphasis on the first-person in *Walden*, and his intention to “brag,” might strike some readers as egotistical. In the manuscript, we can see him revising the title page and several other passages in an effort to express pride in his accomplishment while anticipating how his readers might receive his “bragging.”

Here’s [one way to tell the story of these changes, using TimelineJS](http://bit.ly/2HdlcP6).

### Telling your own revision story

Select some manuscript images to tell your own story about a revision or revisions to *Walden* that strike you as interesting or significant.

***Your timeline needn’t be as complex and detailed as the example you’ve just examined.*** The example is designed to give you some idea of what it’s *possible* to do with TimelineJS as a tool for telling a story about textual fluidity. Your own project will be far simpler.

Remember that you’ll have three full weeks to work on this project.
