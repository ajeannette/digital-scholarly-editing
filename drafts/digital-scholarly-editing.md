title: Digital scholarly editing
---

How has the advent of computers and digital interfaces changed the practice of scholarly editing? This is a big question to which won't attempt a comprehensive answer. Instead, we'll focus on just a few crucial differences between pre-digital scholarly editing and scholarly editing in a digital environment.

One difference that's less crucial than you may think is that between print and screen. While it's true that most scholarly digital editions are designed to be read on a screen, digital scholarly editing as an activity isn't tied to any particular medium; in fact, as we'll see, the separation of content from medium is one of digital scholarly editing's most important features. Meanwhile, though it's a simple task to scan a print scholarly edition and put it on a website as a pdf, it would certainly be odd to say that by doing so we'd turned it into a digital scholarly edition.

But why? After all, the pdf, like everything else delivered to us by a computer, is resolvable at the end of the day into 0's and 1's. And isn't that what it means to be digital? What's it missing?

One thing it's missing, of course, is the intention of the editor or editors to use the affordances of digital technology in creating the edition to begin with. But the most important thing it's missing is this: an approach to the edition's content that treats that content consciously and systematically as *data*.

## Digital editions and data

*Data* isn't a word uttered trippingly on the tongues of most humanists, and if you're new to digital humanities, treating the world of wondrous and inspiring things created by the human imagination as "data" may seem absurdly quanitative and reductive. 

But consider the meaning of *datum*, the singular of the Latin *data*: "a thing given." Data are things, and as wondrous and inspiring as they may be, the things created by the human imagination are &hellip; well, you see where this is going.

"I made a thing!" is the cry of many a creator on the internet. The Victorian advocate of "art for art's sake," Oscar Wilde, asserted that "The artist is the creator of beautiful things." His contemporary, William Morris, made books that are beautiful things to view and hold. He helped inspire a movement, still very much with us today, to make ordinary household objects beautiful things.

The humanities are actually a very thing-y space, a space in which we're often making contact with other people's imaginations through something *material*: a painting, a sculpture, a building, a book, a letter, a manuscript — something that takes up space in the world, that can be measured and weighed and otherwise described.

Not only that, but many of the things that humanists study — books, certainly — are chock full of things. They may be things in a world that doesn't exist, but that just makes them things of a different sort: imaginary things.  If we set about to describe the people, places, and objects in a novel in material terms, taking note of material attributes such as dimensions and colors, we're likely to find we have a lot to say.

Books and other texts are typically filled with abstract as well as material things: structural entities such as titles, chapters, paragraphs, sentences, stanzas, lines, and words; and conceptual entities such as names (not to be confused with the things they name) and figures of speech: metaphors, similes, symbols, etc.

The humanities are actually awash in data, and computers have given humanists unprecedented power to organize this data and connect one bit of it to another. 

Digital scholarly editors use this power in the editions they create. They do so by incorporating information about a text's data right alongside the data itself, in a process we'll have more to say about later: *data-modeling*. After deciding what data in a text needs to be identified in order for the edition to meet its objectives, a digital scholarly editor identifies and often expands on the data using a specialized type of computer language called a *markup language*. 

The simplest digital scholarly editions may rely entirely on the markup language that enables a web browser — Firefox or Chrome, for example — to recognize a paragraph as a paragraph or a list as a list: Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML for short. HTML doesn't permit an editor to say much of substance about a text's data, but an HTML-encoded edition does at least facilitate ouputting the edition in other multiple formats, including PDF, and it enables editors to take some advantage of the digital interface: for example, by creating a *social edition* in which readers can interact with editors and one another around the text.

Many digital editions use the much more powerful markup language XML (short for "Extensible Markup Language"), and in particular an XML standard developed by an organization called the "Text Encoding Initiative." (The abbreviation *TEI* is used for both the organization and the standard.)

In the next module, we'll explore how, as an editor, you would use TEI to create a digital scholarly edition.
