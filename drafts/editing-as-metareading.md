title: Editing as metareading
---

We've seen that for all their differences, the different types of scholarly editing — and of editing more broadly — are united by a common process: bringing forth something new from something already in existence.

We might also say that the varieties of scholarly editing all involve a certain way of reading.

We'll call this way of reading *metareading*. By metareading, we mean a way of reading focused less on what a text _says_ than on what it _is_. To clarify, let's contrast metareading with some other, more familiar kinds of reading.

*Close reading* is a central practice in literary study and the humanities generally. Barbara Herrnstein Smith points out that the term "refers not only to an activity with regard to texts but also to a type of text itself: a technically informed, fine-grained analysis of some piece of writing, usually in connection with some broader question of interest" ("What Was Close Reading," p. 58). She goes on to point out that the "practice has multiple ancestors, including classical rhetorical analysis, biblical exegesis, and legal interpretation, and it also has some cousins, such as iconology and psychoanalysis." 

Smith offers a quick sketch of how the practice has developed in academic literary studies since the 1920s in order to reflect on its relationship to what some digital humanists call *distant reading*: a way of reading that uses the power of computation to surface meaningful patterns across vast multitudes of texts, as in Franco Morretti's computer-assisted analysis of seven thousand novel titles from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century.

N. Katherine Hayles uses the term *machine-reading* for this kind of macroscopic approach, contrasting it both with *close reading* and with *hyperreading*, a term she borrows from James Sosnoski and then expands, using it to cover not only the kind of rapid scanning, skimming, and link-following that readers do when using a search engine but the traditional scholarly practice, in archival research, of sifting through "a great deal of material quickly to find the relevant texts or passages" ("How We Read," 496). 

In her pencil history of close reading, Smith observes that its first influential adherents in the twentieth century, the so-called New Critics, set their practice consciously in opposition to the dominant one of the century's early years, in which "the study of literature consisted largely of the production, transmission, and acquisition of facts about sets of texts," including "titles, publication dates, and sources" of major works, and "readily observable features that distinguished forms, styles, and genres (the medieval romance, the Petrarchan sonnet, the Jacobean drama, and so forth)" (60). 

It's this largely descriptive, empirical approach to texts that we have in mind when we use the term *metareading* here. Practiced as an end in itself, with a mistaken confidence that there are "facts" about literary texts — or about anything in the realm of culture — that one can simply "observe," metareading can indeed end up treating texts as what Smith calls "dusty achievements." But practiced with nuance and as a means to other ends — from the relatively uncomplicated, such as making texts findable, to the highly complicated, such as reaching a nuanced understanding of texts in relation to their contexts — it's a powerful, indeed essential, tool.

Without metareading there would be no library databases (or their predecessors, card catalogs), bibliographies, or citations (footnotes and endnotes). These are all essential scholarly aids precisely because of the empirical data about texts that's stored in them and the regularized way in which the data's been recorded. Carefully constructed bibliographies and properly formatted citations enable scholars to verify other scholars' sources and pursue new directions for research because of the information they contain regarding such mundane details about a text as its author, title, publisher, publication date, and perhaps the title, volume number, issue, and page numbers of the journal in which it was published.

But without metareading, there would also be none of the rich interpretive discussion that we find in sophisticated literary close readings that turn on questions of genre. If we claim that a text represents an instance of a type such as *novel, romance, epic, lyric, pastoral, tragedy, satire, magic realism*, or *speculative fiction*, here again we're making a statement about what the text *is*. In this case, the statement isn't a mere observation but rather a critical judgment, and one with the power to completely re-order our understanding of what the texts *says*. 

Without metareading, we'd have no way to understand a text's meaning or cutural significance in relation to its publishing history (did the author make changes to later editions?), its material self-presentation (three-volume novel or inexpensive, paperbound numbers in a serial?), or its treatment of paratextual features such as the title page (did it display the author's real name? a pseudonym? "Anonymous"? no name at all?).

We'd have no way to think about the text in relation to its date (or dates) of publication and everything else that was going on at that moment in the author's life or the world at large. 

## Metareading and metadata

One might say that the kind of information we're attending to when we're metareading is *metadata*. It's information *about* the objects humanities scholars study. *Metadata* may strike some humanists as a coldly scientific or inappropriately quantitative term to apply to objects as profoundly moving and richly meaningful as, say, the plays of Shakespeare. It shouldn't.
