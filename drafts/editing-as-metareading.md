title: Editing as metareading
---

We've seen that for all their differences, the different types of scholarly editing — and of editing more broadly — are united by a common process: bringing forth something new from something already in existence.

We might also say that the varieties of scholarly editing all involve a certain way of reading.

We'll call this way of reading *metareading*. By metareading, we mean a way of reading focused less on what a text _says_ than on what it _is_. To clarify, let's contrast metareading with some other, more familiar kinds of reading.

*Close reading* is a central practice in literary study and the humanities generally. Barbara Herrnstein Smith points out that the term "refers not only to an activity with regard to texts but also to a type of text itself: a technically informed, fine-grained analysis of some piece of writing, usually in connection with some broader question of interest" ("What Was Close Reading," p. 58). She goes on to point out that the "practice has multiple ancestors, including classical rhetorical analysis, biblical exegesis, and legal interpretation, and it also has some cousins, such as iconology and psychoanalysis." 

Smith offers a quick sketch of how the practice has developed in academic literary studies since the 1920s in order to reflect on its relationship to what some digital humanists call *distant reading*: a way of reading that uses the power of computation to surface meaningful patterns across vast multitudes of texts, as in Franco Morretti's computer-assisted analysis of seven thousand novel titles from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century.

N. Katherine Hayles uses the term *machine-reading* for this kind of macroscopic approach, contrasting it both with *close reading* and with *hyperreading*, a term she borrows from James Sosnoski and then expands, using it to cover not only the kind of rapid scanning, skimming, and link-following that readers do when using a search engine but the traditional scholarly practice, in archival research, of sifting through "a great deal of material quickly to find the relevant texts or passages" ("How We Read," 496). 

In her pencil history of close reading, Smith observes that its first influential adherents in the twentieth century, the so-called New Critics, set their practice consciously in opposition to the dominant one of the century's early years, in which "the study of literature consisted largely of the production, transmission, and acquisition of facts about sets of texts," including "titles, publication dates, and sources" of major works, and "readily observable features that distinguished forms, styles, and genres (the medieval romance, the Petrarchan sonnet, the Jacobean drama, and so forth)" (60). 

It's this largely descriptive, empirical approach to texts that we have in mind when we use the term *metareading* here. Practiced as an end in itself, with a mistaken confidence that there are "facts" about literary texts — or about anything in the realm of culture — that one can simply "observe," this approach can indeed end up treating texts as what Smith calls "dusty achievements." But practiced ...
