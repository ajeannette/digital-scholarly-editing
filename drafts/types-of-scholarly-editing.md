title: Types of scholarly editing

In these modules, we won't attempt a comprehensive overview of scholarly editing in all its varieties. Instead, we'll describe a few of the most common varieties and pay closest attention to those types of scholarly editing most relevant to our example text, the manuscript of *Walden*.

## Critical scholarly editing

A great deal of scholarly editing concerns itself with texts that exist in more than one version. Before the print era, the practice of copying texts by hand led inevitably to errors of transmission and raised questions about the best way to establish an authoritative reading text from the resulting variants. The widespread adoption of movable type from the 15th-century onwards made textual transmission more reliable but produced new sources of textual variation. Compositors might make mistakes in setting up type. Unauthorized and pirated editions of popular texts might contain errors or deliberate alterations. In the anglophone world, British and American editions of the same work might differ for a variety of reasons, including differing publishing-house policies with respect to subject-matter that might offend readers' sensibilities. The relative ease of producing a new print edition of an already published work enabled writers to revise and republish their own texts, putting new versions in circulation alongside previous ones.

Whether dealing with manuscripts or printed works, scholarly editors face the task of bringing forth, from the multiple states of a given text, an "edition" for readers to read or scholars to study. The task requires deep knowledge about the history of writing, books, and publishing, and is best informed by a critical understanding of the political, economic, social, and biographical contexts surrounding the production of the text in question. It also involves making critical judgments about matters such as textual authenticity and authorial intention. For this reason, scholarly editions of this type are sometimes called *critical editions*, and the systematic study of texts *as texts* — with attention to the material and historical dimensions of their production — is sometimes referred to as *textual criticism* or *textual scholarship*.

## Documentary editing

By bringing forth a single edition of a work from multiple sources, particularly a literary work, critical scholarly editing facilitates the close study and interpretation of that work, perhaps, though not always, with the aim of helping readers arrive at the best possible understanding of the author's intentions in writing it. If we want to talk about the meaning of a poem by William Blake or Emily Dickinson, or a novel by Herman Melville or Richard Wright, we might well feel that we first need to establish just what words we should be interpreting — just what the text *is* that we're talking about. (We might not feel that way, and there are plenty of scholars who don't. More about them below.)

But there are other kinds of text for which this approach isn't appropriate — for example, letters and other historical documents "whose
unique physical characteristics and original nature give them special evidentiary value," to quote Mary Jo Kline and Susan Holbrook Perdue, authors of [*A Guide to Documentary Editing* (3rd edition)](https://gde.upress.virginia.edu/01A-gde.html). To be valuable to someone studying these documents as historical evidence, a scholarly edition of them must aim to present as full and accurate a representation of the originals as possible, with only limited critical editorial intervention. 

Documentary editing, "although noncritical in terms of classical textual scholarship, is hardly an uncritical endeavor," Kline and Perdue point out. "It demands as much intelligence, insight, and hard work as its critical counterpart, combined with a passionate determination to preserve for modern readers the nuances of evidence."
