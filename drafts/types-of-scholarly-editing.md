title: Types of scholarly editing
---

In these modules, we won't attempt a comprehensive overview of scholarly editing in all its varieties. Instead, we'll describe a few of the most common varieties and pay closest attention to those types of scholarly editing most relevant to our example text, the manuscript of *Walden*.

## Critical scholarly editing

A great deal of scholarly editing concerns itself with texts that exist in more than one version. Before the print era, the practice of copying texts by hand led inevitably to errors of transmission and raised questions about the best way to establish an authoritative reading text from the resulting variants. The widespread adoption of movable type from the 15th-century onwards made textual transmission more reliable but produced new sources of textual variation. Compositors might make mistakes in setting up type. Unauthorized and pirated editions of popular texts might contain errors or deliberate alterations. In the anglophone world, British and American editions of the same work might differ for a variety of reasons, including differing publishing-house policies with respect to subject-matter that might offend readers' sensibilities. The relative ease of producing a new print edition of an already published work enabled writers to revise and republish their own texts, putting new versions in circulation alongside previous ones.

Whether dealing with manuscripts or printed works, scholarly editors face the task of bringing forth, from the multiple states of a given text, an "edition" for readers to read or scholars to study. The task requires deep knowledge about the history of writing, books, and publishing, together with a critical understanding of the political, economic, social, and biographical contexts surrounding the production of the text in question. It also involves choosing critically among alternative theoretical approaches and making critical judgments about matters such as textual authenticity and authorial intention. For these reasons, scholarly editions of this type are sometimes called *critical editions*, and the systematic study of texts *as texts* — with attention to the material and historical dimensions of their production, and informed by a consideration of differing textual and editorial theories — is sometimes referred to as *textual criticism* or *textual scholarship*.

## Documentary editing

By bringing forth a single edition of a work from multiple sources, particularly a literary work, critical scholarly editing, as described above, facilitates the close study and interpretation of that work, perhaps, though not always, with the aim of helping readers arrive at the best possible understanding of the author's intentions in writing it. If we want to talk about the meaning of a poem by William Blake or Emily Dickinson, or a novel by Herman Melville or Richard Wright, we might well feel that we first need to establish just what words we should be interpreting — just what the text *is* that we're talking about. (We might not feel that way, and there are certainly scholars who don't. More about them below.)

But there are other kinds of text for which this just isn't the right approach — for example, letters and other historical documents "whose
unique physical characteristics and original nature give them special evidentiary value," to quote Mary Jo Kline and Susan Holbrook Perdue, authors of [*A Guide to Documentary Editing* (3rd edition)](https://gde.upress.virginia.edu/01A-gde.html). To be valuable to someone studying these documents as historical evidence, a scholarly edition of them must aim to present as full and accurate a representation of the originals as possible, with only limited critical editorial intervention. 

Documentary editing, "although noncritical in terms of classical textual scholarship, is hardly an uncritical endeavor," Kline and Perdue point out. "It demands as much intelligence, insight, and hard work as its critical counterpart, combined with a passionate determination to preserve for modern readers the nuances of evidence."

## Editing for textual recovery

Some of the most important scholarly editing taking place today has as its aim the recovery of texts that have been forgotten or overlooked, often because their authors came from oppressed or marginalized groups. The increasing prominence of editing for textual recovery reflects, among other things, growing attention to the politics of authorship and publishing, a determination to multiply and diversify the voices that "count" as culturally important in criticism and in the classroom, an attempt to improve our understanding of the past by re-publishing works that had a significant impact in their time but have since faded from cultural memory, and an effort to bring aesthetically undervalued texts the attention they deserve. It also reflects, of course, the fact that digital technology has lowered the barrier to accomplishing all of these aims by making past texts easier to find, edit, and distribute. 

The kind of edition that scholarly editing for textual recovery "brings forth" may or may not be based on multiple versions of a text or require commitment to a particular theory of textuality, but it's one that's typically critical in the important sense of providing scholarly context in the form of an editorial introduction and annotations, and sometimes in the form of ancillary materials — such as contemporary documents or original reviews — that provide important critical perspective on the work's genesis, significance, or reception.

## Genetic editing

In cases where an author's drafts have been preserved — in manuscripts, typescripts, or digital files — it's possible to take an editorial approach aimed at representing and illuminating how a particular text came to be. "The geneticists get their name," writes John Bryant in *The Fluid Text: A Theory of Revision and Editing for Book and Screen* (1988), "from their basic assumption that a literary work is equivalent to the processes of genesis that create it and that a *genetic edition* of a work must display the process as it progresses through its various stages of composition and revision." Genetic editing, especially as practiced in France from the mid-1960's onward under the influence of structuralism and post-structuralism, may concern itself less with uncovering authorial meaning and more with shedding light on the creative process itself. But it offers the possibility, as well, of re-focusing our view of particular texts and the authorial intentions that inhabit them, so that, even as we retain an understanding of some text as manifesting its author's unique, personal outlook, we appreciate that neither the text nor the outlook can  be regarded as fixed, stable, or unitary.

For his 1967 PhD dissertation, "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text," Ronald E. Clapper used the manuscript of *Walden* at the Huntington Library (HM 924) to produce a scholarly edition of Thoreau's text that we can read with an eye toward understanding creativity or Thoreau or both. The dissertation prints the first edition of *Walden*, published by Ticknor and Fields in 1854, with a footnote at every point where the wording or the ordering of content varies from one or more of the seven manuscript versions Thoreau drafted between 1846, while he was still living at Walden Pond, and the published text.

An important consideration for all scholarly editions that incorporate multiple pre- or post-publication versions of a text is how to display the textual variants so that readers can easily understand them. In genetic editing, the number and complexity of variants can make the task can a monumental one. The options for editors here have been profoundly affected by the development of digital interfaces displaying text.

We'll have more to say about digital interfaces in a subsequent module.
