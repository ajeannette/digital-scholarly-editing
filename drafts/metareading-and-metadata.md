title: From metareading to markup
---

In the previous module, we suggested that the humanities are a space rich in things — paintings, sculptures, buildings, books, letters, manuscripts, and so on — and that the *textual* things humanists deal with (novels, plays, poems, journals, essays, and the like) are themselves rich in things, some of them material (book covers, for example, or graphic illustrations), some of them conceptual (such as characters and metaphors), some of them structural (titles, chapters, paragraphs, lines, stanzas, etc.).

We also introduced the term [metareading](/introduction/editing-as-metareading) to refer to a way of reading that's focused less on what a text *says* than on what it *is*.

Bringing these two points together, we might say that metareading does what it does by attending to texts as things and the things in texts.

As we've explained, there's nothing new about this way of working with texts. Using one or another kind of systematic nomenclature, bibliographers and librarians have long made it possible to identify and sort texts by the kinds of things they are or contain. Scholarly editors have long sought to bring forth, from one or more versions of a text, an edition that not only delivers the text's content but also carefully describes the text as a thing and the things in the text. This careful description, we noted, is not simply a process of recording observations; it requires judgment and interpretation.

Digital scholarly editing is thus a relatively new enterprise that belongs to a very old tradition. Its most important contribution to that tradition is its description of textual things *in a language that a computer can understand*. This kind of description opens up a world of possibilities. Software applications that can read and understand the descriptive language in a digital scholarly edition can, among other things, display the textual content in a variety of formats, extract bits of that content for re-presentation in charts and tables, surface patterns in that content that it would be difficult to detect through ordinary reading, and link  content within an edition to other content on the internet, including content in other digital editions.

The use of a standardized, machine-readable language to describe texts-as-things and things-in-texts is known as *text-encoding*. There are a variety of such languages, known generically as *markup*. HTML ("Hyptertext Markup Language") is one. XML ("eXtensible Markup Language") is another. As its name suggests, XML's great virtue is that it can be stretched to accommodate new uses. In fact, XML is a general-purpose markup language that can itself be used to create markup languages by defining the terms of those languages.

XML is the preferred markup language for digital scholarly editions because it gives editors the ability to describe texts and their contents employing widely used terms in combination with highly particular ones invented to suit the needs of an individual project. Even these project-specific terms will be readable by a computer because XML gives editors the ability to point, in their marked-up files, to a lexicon of sorts where the terms have been defined.
