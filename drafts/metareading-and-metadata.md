title: Metareading and metaredata

In the previous module, we suggested that the humanities are a space rich in things — paintings, sculptures, buildngs, books, letters, manuscripts, and so on — and that the textual things humanists deals with (such as novels, plays, poems, journals, essays, and the like) are themselves rich in things, some of them material (book covers, for example, or graphic illustrations), some of them conceptual (characters, metaphors), some of them structural (titles, chapters, paragraphs, lines, stanzas, etc.).

Let's zero in for a moment on some of these structural elements.

<!-- Terms for describing the parts of texts and the types of words used in them have been around for a long time. Books typically have *titles*, and these often appear on a *title page*. Longer books are frequently divided into *chapters*; chapters generally begin with *chapter titles* and may contain *chapter headings* and *subheadings*. Poems typically consist of *lines* which are frequently divided into *stanzas*. Dramas are divided into *acts* in which dialog is spoken by *speakers*. And so on. We learn such terms so early on in our literary education that we rarely give them a moment’s thought. Much less do we think of them as constituting a specialized technical vocabulary, a *metalanguage* for describing the language that books are made of or the physcial parts of those books. But that’s exactly what they are. -->
