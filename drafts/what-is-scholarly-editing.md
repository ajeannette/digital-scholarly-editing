title: What is scholarly editing?
---

Let's begin with *editing* in the broadest sense. The root of the word, and of related words such as *editor* and *edition*, is the Latin *edere*: to bring forth or produce. Editors bring things forth. Mainly, for our purposes, texts.

But there are, of course, other purposes, and it's worth stopping for a moment to consider at least one of them. As Google's ngram viewer dramatically illustrates, [we're a lot more likely these days to encounter writing about *gene editing* than *text editing*](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gene+editing%2C+text+editing&year_end=2019&year_start=1800&smoothing=3&corpus=26&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgene%20editing%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctext%20editing%3B%2Cc0). One kind of editing has to do with biology, the other with cultural artifacts. But they have a few important things in common. Scientists edit genes by taking existing genetic material and changing it. What they "bring forth" or "produce" in this way isn't the same as what organisms bring forth through the biological process of reproduction. Similarly, what editors of texts bring forth isn't the same as what authors bring forth when they give birth to new poems, plays, novels, and other literary works. It makes sense to talk about gene editing because we already have the idea of editing as the act of altering something previously brought forth to produce something new.

We also already have the idea of editing as a process intended to improve through change. DNA may be
["inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing#Gene_therapy) for the purpose improving the organism's ability to fight disease, just as words may be inserted, deleted, modified, or replaced in an author's manuscript by a publishing-house editor seeking to help the author produce a better short story.

Here, however, we come to a point of departure between the several varieties of editing aimed at improving a text before it's published (such as copyediting to improve fluency and eliminate errors of grammar, usage and punctuation), and scholarly editing, which, if it aims to improve at all, does so in a very different way. Scholarly editing, like all textual editing, brings forth something new from an existing text or texts. But it does this for particular reasons, and in a particular way.

## Types of scholarly editing

Scholarly editing concerns itself with texts that exist, or are presumed to exist, in more than one version. Before the print era, the practice of copying texts by hand led inevitably to errors of transmission and raised questions about the best way to establish an authoritative reading text from the resulting variants. With the widespread adoption of movable type from the 15th-century onwards, textual transmission became more, but still not completely, reliable. Unauthorized and pirated editions of popular texts might contain errors or deliberate alterations. In the anglophone world, British and American editions of the same work might differ for a variety of reasons, including differing publishing-house policies with respect to subject-matter that might offend readers' sensibilities. The relative ease of producing a new print edition of an already published work enabled writers to revise and republish their own texts, putting new versions in circulation alongside previous ones.

Whether dealing with manuscripts or printed works, scholarly editors face the task of bringing forth, from the multiple states of a given text, an "edition" for readers to read or scholars to study. The task requires knowledge about such matters as handwriting, scribal practice, editorial practice (of the pre-publication type described above) within different publishing houses, and authors' biographies. It also involves making critical judgments about matters like authorial intention. For this reason, scholarly editions are also sometimes called *critical editions*, and the systematic study of texts *as texts* — with attention to the material and historical dimensions of their production — is sometimes referred to as *textual criticism*.
