title: What is scholarly editing?
---

Let's begin with *editing* in the broadest sense. The root of the word, and of related words such as *editor* and *edition*, is the Latin *edere*: to bring forth or produce. Editors bring things forth. Mainly, for our purposes, texts.

But there are, of course, other purposes, and it's worth stopping for a moment to consider at least one of them. As Google's ngram viewer dramatically illustrates, [we're a lot more likely these days to encounter writing about *gene editing* than *text editing*](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gene+editing%2C+text+editing&year_end=2019&year_start=1800&smoothing=3&corpus=26&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgene%20editing%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctext%20editing%3B%2Cc0). One kind of editing has to do with biology, the other with cultural artifacts. But they have a few important things in common. Scientists edit genes by taking existing genetic material and changing it. What they "bring forth" or "produce" in this way isn't the same as what organisms bring forth through the biological process of reproduction. Similarly, what editors of texts bring forth isn't the same as what authors bring forth when they give birth to new poems, plays, novels, and other literary works. It makes sense to talk about gene editing because we already have the idea of editing as the act of altering something previously brought forth to produce something new.

We also already have the idea of editing as a process intended to improve through change. DNA may be
["inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing#Gene_therapy) for the purpose improving the organism's ability to fight disease, just as words may be inserted, deleted, modified, or replaced in an author's manuscript by a publishing-house editor seeking to help the author produce a better short story.

Here, however, we come to a point of departure between the several varieties of editing aimed at improving a text before it's published (such as copyediting to improve fluency and eliminate errors of grammar, usage and punctuation), and scholarly editing, which, if it aims to improve at all, do so in a very different way. Scholarly editing, like all textual editing, brings forth something new from an existing text or texts. But it does this for particular reasons, and in a particular way.
