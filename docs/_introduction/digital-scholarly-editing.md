title: Digital scholarly editing
---

How has the advent of computers and digital interfaces changed the practice of scholarly editing? 

In the 1970s, scholarly editors began using computers rather than typewriters to prepare copy for publishing, and publishing houses began using computers and photography, rather than metal type and forms, to turn the copy into a printed book. Yet scholarly editions produced by this digital process were not what we would call digital scholarly editions.

<!-- In the modern pre-digital world, the text of a scholarly edition was typically created on a typewriter. A compositor at the publishing house set the typewritten copy in hot lead, using a Linotype or similar machine. In this process the machine operator manually entered each character of the text, formatting the copy into lines. The metal lines of type were arranged in a form; the ultimate product was a book printed on paper.

In the 1970s, scholarly editors entered the digital world: they began using computers to prepare copy for publishing. The term “digital” refers to the way a computer stores information: each item is translated into a binary number, an eight-character sequence of the digits zero and one (for example, the letter “a” is represented in binary as 010000001). 

In the initial use of digital technology, the text of the edition was typed into a word-processing program and the resulting file was submitted to the publisher. No more hot lead: the copy didn’t have to be retyped or otherwise reproduced, and the compositor’s job was to encode the file for printing by a computer-assisted process. But the result was the same: the digital process was used to make a book printed on paper. -->

At about the same time, some scholars began to ask how computers might be used to change the aims and methods of scholarly editing itself, taking longstanding traditions in new directions. Looking at their work and the developments that have flowed from it, we can see that it's marked by a particular editorial approach, one that consciously and systematically treats texts and their contents as *data* worthy of scholarly attention.

It's this approach, rather than any particular mode of production or user interface, that distinguishes digital scholarly editing from scholarly editing in the pre-digital era.  

## Digital editions and data

"Data" isn't a word uttered trippingly on the tongues of most humanists, and if you're new to digital humanities, treating the world of wondrous and inspiring things created by the human imagination as data may seem absurdly quantitative and reductive. 

But consider the meaning of *datum*, the singular of the Latin *data*: "a thing given." Data are things, and as wondrous and inspiring as they may be, the things created by the human imagination are &hellip; well, you see where this is going.

"I made a thing!" is the cry of many a creator on the internet. The Victorian advocate of "art for art's sake," Oscar Wilde, asserted that "The artist is the creator of beautiful things." His contemporary, William Morris, made books that are beautiful things to view and hold. He helped inspire a movement, still very much with us today, to make ordinary household objects beautiful things.

The humanities are actually a very thing-y space, a space in which we're often making contact with other people's imaginations through *material* things: a painting, a sculpture, a building, a book, a letter, a manuscript — a thing that takes up space in the world, that can be measured and weighed and otherwise described.

Not only that, but many of the things that humanists study — books, certainly — are chock full of things. They may be things in a world that doesn't exist, but that just makes them things of a different sort: *imaginary* things.  If we set about to describe the people, places, and objects in a novel in material terms, taking note of material attributes such as dimensions and colors, we're likely to find we have a lot to say.

Books and other texts are typically filled with abstract as well as material things: structural entities such as titles, chapters, paragraphs, sentences, stanzas, lines, and words; and conceptual entities such as names (not to be confused with the things they name) and figures of speech: metaphors, similes, symbols, etc.

Humanists have always taken an interest in these things. As noted earlier, bibliographers and librarians have long made it possible to identify and sort texts by the kinds of things they are or contain. Scholarly editors have long sought to bring forth, from one or more versions of a text, an edition that not only delivers the text's content but also carefully describes the text as a thing and the things in the text. This careful description, we noted, is not simply a process of recording observations; *metareading*, as we've called it, frequently requires judgment and interpretation.

When we say that digital scholarly editing treats texts and their content consciously and systematically as *data*, all we really mean is that it seeks to describe texts-as-things and things-in-texts *in a language that a computer can understand*. Doing so opens up new ways to think about and interact with texts. Software applications capable of reading the descriptive language in a digital scholarly edition can, among other things, display the textual content in a variety of formats, extract bits of that content for re-presentation in charts and tables, surface patterns in that content that it would be difficult to detect through ordinary reading, and link content within an edition to other content on the internet, including content in other digital editions. 

The use of a standardized, machine-readable language to describe textual data is known as *text-encoding*. In the next module, we'll look at what text-encoding is, some of the ways it can be done, and how it changes what can be accomplished in a scholarly edition.

<!-- Digital scholarly editors use this power in the editions they create. They do so by incorporating information about a text's data right alongside the data itself, in a process we'll have more to say about later: *data modeling*. After deciding what data in a text needs to be identified in order for the edition to meet its objectives, a digital scholarly editor identifies and often expands on the data using a specialized type of computer language called a *markup language*. 

The simplest digital scholarly editions may rely entirely on the markup language that enables a web browser — Firefox or Chrome, for example — to recognize a paragraph as a paragraph or a list as a list: Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML for short. HTML doesn't permit an editor to say much of substance about a text's data, but an HTML-encoded edition does at least facilitate outputting the edition in other multiple formats, including pdf, and it enables editors to take some advantage of the digital interface: for example, by creating a *social edition* in which readers can interact with editors and one another around the text.

Many digital editions use the much more powerful markup language XML (short for "Extensible Markup Language"), and in particular an XML standard developed by an organization called the "Text Encoding Initiative." (The abbreviation "TEI" is used for both the organization and the standard.)

In the next module, we'll explore how, as an editor, you would use TEI to create a digital scholarly edition. -->
