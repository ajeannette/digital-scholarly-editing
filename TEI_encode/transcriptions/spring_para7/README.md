# What's here

September 13, 2020

“Read this first overview” of the files I’ve created containing the transcripts, edited versions of the material in the selections, and a table comparing each sentence in the selection with versions of that sentence in the drafts.

We chose the following selection from paragraph 7 in “Spring” as the example for the October presentation:

[¶7a] The whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides, the produce of one spring day. What makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence thus suddenly. When I see on the one side the inert bank,—for the sun acts on one side first,—and on the other this luxuriant foliage, the creation of an hour, I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in the laboratory of the Artist who made the world and me,—had come to where he was still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs about. [¶7b] I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this sandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body. You find thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No wonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea inwardly. The atoms have already learned this law, and are pregnant by it. The overhanging leaf sees here its prototype. (*Walden*, Princeton UP [1971], p. 306, and [Fluid Text](http://digitalthoreau.org/walden/fluid/text/17.html))

Versions related to this selection appear in six documents.

Three versions are located in Journal MS volumes at the Morgan Library: 2 (December 29 and 31, 1851); 3 (March 15, 1852), and 5 (March 2, 1854). Three are located in the Walden MS, HM 924, at the Huntington Library. Version 4 is in draft F (Late 1853 to Early 1854), and version 6 is in draft G (February and March 1854). Version 1 is located in Draft F, but it’s on leaves of a now fragmentary Journal volume that Thoreau kept from winter 1846-1847 until spring 1848; version 1 dates from spring 1848.

Only versions 2 and 3, both located in Journal entries, show no revisions. All of the other versions show revisions in ink and pencil.

## Files containing transcripts and edited versions of the material in the selections

I made a Word file for each version:

| Version | Location of MS (filename for transcript and edited versions) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Journal entry (Winter/Spring 1848), located in HM 924, volume 5, draft F; published in PE Journal 2, pp. 383, 577-578 (`Spring_para7_1_in J_1848_HM924v6_F.docx`) |
| 2 | Journal entries (December 29 and 31, 1851), located in MA 1302.14, published in PE *Journal 4* (`Spring_para7_2_in_J_1851_12.docx`) |
| 3 |  Journal entry (March 15, 1852), located in MA 1302.15, published in PE *Journal 4* (`Spring_para7_3_in_J_1852_3.docx`) |
| 4 | Draft F (Late 1853 to Early 1854), volume 6 in HM 924 (`Spring_para7_4_in_HM924v6_F_1853-54.docx`) |
| 5 | Journal entry (March 2, 1854), located in MA 1302.23, published in PE *Journal 8* (`Spring_para7_5_in_J_1854_3.docx`) |
| 6 | Draft G (February and March 1854), volume 7 in HM 924 (`Spring_para7_6_in_HM924v7_G_1854.docx`) |

Each Word file begins with a diplomatic transcript or transcripts. For 1, 4, and 6 — the versions located in HM 924 — I’ve transcribed entire pages. For 2, 3, and 5 — the versions in MS volumes of the Journal — I’ve transcribed only the portion of the Journal entry that contains the text of the version.

For the versions that contain revisions — 1, 4, 5, and 6 — the diplomatic transcript is followed by the material in the selection before any revising, and then presentations of the material edited to show what I judge to be Thoreau’s intention for each layer of revision.

In general, I assume that ink revisions and pencilled revisions belong to different chronological sequences. In general, I have not noted small changes, like reforming single letters, that Thoreau pretty clearly made during the original inditing. In some cases I’ve included notes about complications in determining the revision sequence.

Sorting out layers of revision is a tricky business. For text in ink, I take into account ink color, angle of writing, and smoothness or roughness of the ink line, which is an indication of Thoreau’s using different nibs. With high-res images it’s also sometimes possible to see whether the initial layer of ink was wet or dry when the second layer was applied. If it was dry, the edges of the lines in the second layer can be sharper where they cross lines in the first layer, and can seem to float over them. If it was wet, the lines in the second layer can merge with lines they cross in the first layer. For text in pencil, it’s sometimes possible to tell that different pencils have been used by the quality of the line: some pencils, perhaps those with harder lead, produce a thinner, more uniform gray line; others, perhaps those with softer lead, produce a line that’s wider and spottier, with darker flecks visible. It’s harder to be certain about pencilled material, though, because it interacts differently with different papers: lead can be rubbed into softer paper and it can be rubbed off of paper with a harder surface.

Another factor to keep in mind is that while it’s possible to establish a somewhat defensible revision sequence within a given portion of one draft, it’s very difficult to know when revisions within one draft were made with respect to the times of creation and revision of other drafts. The dates of Journal entries made in intact Journal MS volumes establish when they were originally written (with some margin of error, though, because we know that Thoreau sometimes wrote several entries at a single sitting using rough pencilled notes that he kept during his walks over several days). For drafts in the Walden MS, it’s important to keep in mind that we can’t determine the relationship between the current arrangement of the leaves and the arrangement(s) Thoreau created with them. We don’t even know how many rearrangements Thoreau made himself: the varied sets of pinholes in the margins demonstrate that he moved leaves around as he worked on the book.

## Table comparing each sentence in the selection with versions of that sentence in the drafts

Shanley’s arrangement provides a useful way to think about the large time periods during which Thoreau worked on parts of *Walden*, but when you get down into questions about when a given passage was composed and revised, you have to be prepared to entertain challenges to or revisions of the broader picture, as I discovered when I used the files of versions to make a table in which I compared each sentence in the selection with all the presentations of that sentence, as originally written and as revised (`Spring_para7_selection_for_presentation_final_vs_drafts.docx`).

The first three sentences in the selection (“The whole bank &hellip; ”; “What makes this &hellip;”; “When I see &hellip;”) make their appearances in the 1848 Journal material that’s grouped with draft F in HM 924. Several 1851 and 1852 Journal entries may have contributed to Thoreau’s work on the third sentence, and forms of all three sentences are also present in a portion of F that dates from later than the 1848 leaves, and in G. So for these three sentences the order posited by Shanley’s arrangement works, with a couple of tweaks.

The first appearance of the words in the final four sentences in the selection (“You find thus &hellip;”; “No wonder that &hellip;”: “The atoms have &hellip;”; “The overhanging leaf &hellip;”), however, are in a March 2, 1854, Journal entry. They also appear in a portion of F, which is dated later 1853-early 1854. Following Shanley’s arrangement, the composition of the material in F would precede the Journal version, but I think it’s possible, perhaps likely, that Thoreau drafted these sentences in his Journal in early March 1854 and incorporated them into *Walden* after that. Shanley’s concluding date for F, “early 1854,” wouldn’t be wrong, but close examination of more parts of F, and of G, might enable us to date those parts more precisely and refine the relationship between F and G. That would also give us a clearer picture of Thoreau’s process and his timing as he worked on the final sections of *Walden*.
