Scholarly annotation can take many forms, from footnotes or endnotes in a printed book to embedded comments within an electronic document. What ties all of these varieties of annotation together is that they allow an author or editor of a work to increase the amount of information available to a reader, which in turn can enable a deeper understanding of and engagement with the underlying content. When reading Thoreau's *Walden* MS a contemporary reader unfamiliar with outdated terminology [example of archaism?] or the geography around Concord, Massachussets [example of placename?] where the narrative is set, is likely to need some help. By annotating a historical text such as *Walden*, its editors can allow a greater number of readers to comprehend the text without the need to constantly turn back and forth to a dictionary, an atlas, or, most likely, an unreliable Google search.

On the other hand, however, excessive annotation can be distracting or, even worse, cut short the full range of interpretations a reader might want to make of the text they are reading. (Example of an overweening annotation?). An editor is a mediator, working to negotiate between the source documents of an edition and the needs or interests of its eventual users.

Creating an annotation strategy, then, requires careful attention to the needs and habits of an edition's eventual audience(s). For example, if the goal of the *Walden* MS edition is to reach a broad audience of students and scholars, we might ask ourselves as editors:

- What information not already available within the body of the text being edited would a high school student need to be able to understand the narrative?

- What would a college student require?

- Are there specific details that even a scholar familiar with the writings of this period would not likely comprehend without assistance?

(Need to know more about what our annotation strategy is ...)
