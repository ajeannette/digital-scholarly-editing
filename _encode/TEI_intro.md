## Introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative 

In previous modules we have been emphasizing the importance of collaboration and community in building digital edition projects. In this module we introduce a long-standing international community, the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/), who maintain a set of Guidelines for representing texts in digital, machine-readable form. 

The TEI originated at the Poughkeepsie Planning Conference at Vassar College in November 1987, at a moment just preceding the formulation of markup languages for machine-reaable documents in the 1990s. At that moment, several different corporations were emerging with their own distinct, competing methods for representing texts electronically. The Poughkeepsie conference defined [“The Poughkeepsie Principles”](https://tei-c.org/Vault/ED/edp01.htm) for providing “a standard format for data interchange in humanities research” in which documents would be described or “marked up” in a common language, readable by computers as well as machines. The concept of human and computer **interchange** is often seen as a core value and goal for the TEI community: to prepare electronic documents in a way that can be shared across different kinds of computers and comprehended by human readers without having to consult the original encoders of a document in person. The concept of interchange is so important to the coding community that people sometimes reference it as the “I” in the TEI.  

The TEI is not the only way to represent documents digitally. However, it is the shared markup language of a community of practice that includes scholarly editors and people who care about representing texts in ways that curate not only their structure and content, but also their metadata. It is a highly expressive language and a powerful tool for building and sharing digital scholarly editions around the world.

## Notes for developing this: 
* Take a look at Lou Burnard's TEI intro book and reference it.
* Introduce 
     * What are “markup languages”? Gloss SGML, HTML, XML. Discuss HTML and XML in a little more detail as they relate and differ. 
     * XML Tree structure and Hierarchy. 
     * Elements and attributes. 
     * Well-formedness. 
* Introduce a basic TEI structure (use oXygen's TEI template), and point out the major hierarchical portions. 
* Modeling problems to discuss:
    * Overhapping hierarchies (first a simple poem: Do we care more about the structure of the lines or the structure of grammatical sentences?)
    * TEI method for handling this. Is it problematic?
    * A serious hierarchy problem for digital editions: Do we care more about page-by-page representation or semantic unit by unit (as in chapters, letters, volumes)? 
    * Examples: Fluid-text edition of Walden, vs. Shelley-Godwin Archive page rendering.
    * Discussion of controversies and multiple ways of encoding “primary source” materials in the TEI
